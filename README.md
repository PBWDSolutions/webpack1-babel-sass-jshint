# webpack v1.14.0 babel-sass-jshint
A empty Skeleton starting point using webpack 1 [Babel Sass JSHint]

running webpack will build bundle.js and compile styles.scss to stylesheets/styles.css 
your js files will be run through JSHint 

Bable is used to convert any ES6 code to ES2015.

cd into the main directory 

run npm install

run webpack to build

add -p flag to compress your js files.

Thanks Paul
